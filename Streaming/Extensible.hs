{- | An item of type @Effects fs m r@ is basically a free monad over @fs@, 
     a list or sum of effects: 
     @fs :: [* -> *]@ . Using familiar expedients, we arranged that though 
     the individual types listed need not be functors, the sum of them 
     @Eff fs@ must be. So @Stream (Eff fs) m@ is also a monad if @m@ is. 

     Thus it might be that by accumulating effects in a do-block 
     you end up with something that might be rendered concrete as

> type MyEffects = [State Int, Twitter, Of String, Reader Config, State String]

     In fact one would rarely use such a signature, but use a system of classes
     which record that these effects are present in the sum, without committing 
     oneself to order, and permitting it to be fused with programs with 
     different effects. Concretization arises as we approach the moment of 
     \"interpretation\". 

     Such an item (like anything of type @Stream f m r@) can be viewed as 
     a coroutine with 'm' as the ambient monad. Here the 
     the progress of events in the underlying succession is broken up or \'suspended\'
     by different \'effects\' in @fs@. These are \"handled\"  by being somehow
     mapped down into the ambient flow of events (which may of course be 'Identity').

     @Effects@  is a type synonym. One should know better, but the expansion is fairly
     intelligible in error messages. Everything we say maps immediately to 
     @FreeT (Effs fs) m r@ from the 
     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-4.12.1/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-Free.html free> library and 
     @Coroutine (Effs fs) m r@ from the 
     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-coroutine-0.9.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Coroutine.html monad-coroutine>
     library, or one of the other equivalents. 
     So modules like @Data.Functors.Effs@ should properly 
     be independent of any particular implementation of effectful free monads or
     coroutines.

type Effects fs m = Stream (Effs fs) m


{- | The effects stored in an @Effs@ sum needn't be functors,
     but are effectively \'functorized\' by an equivalent of

> data Lan f r = forall x . Lan (f x) (x -> r) 

     i.e.

> data UnGADT f r = forall x . UnGADT (f x) (x -> r)


     which always has a functor instance no matter how trashy f is.

     So our standard way of lifting an effect into a stream of many effects
     has that stereotyped form of @liftEff@  So, for example, taking a right-strict pair
     @Of a r@ to represent the @yield@ statement, whe might write:

> yield x = liftEff (x :> ()) id

     rather than, say

> yield x = liftF (x :> ())

     as we would with e.g. @Control.Monad.Free@  Similarly, given

> data State s r where
>   Get :: State s s
>   Put :: a -> State s ()

    which is /way/ not a functor, we would write

> get = liftEff Get id 
> put s = liftEff (Put s) (\() -> ())

     Now we are ready to use sensible looking combinators in an extensible do-block.

> incr_both = do
>  n <- get
>  put (succ n :: Int)
>  m <- get
>  put (succ m :: Integer)

     Here we are collecting state under two headings, @Int@ and @Integer@. Note
     the necessity of forcing line-by-line monomorphism, which is characteristic
     of all \"extensible effects\" approaches.
     
     Each interpreter, in collapsing such a stream, must also reckon with the fact 
     that the individual effects need not have functor instances.

{- | When we have \'handled\' the various effects in a complex
     stream of effects, e.g. @[State Int, Twitter, Of String, Reader Int]@ we

     no \'effects\' remain \'suspended\' in the ambient monad. 
     With @runEffects@ we dissolve back into the primordial flux 
     from which we emerged, whatever that flux may be.
