# extensible-streaming

It is an apriori of the extensible effects campaign that we are trying to avoid monad transformers. 

But why would I want to resist monad transformers? 

On the other hand, though, what could be more pleasing than to work with an extensible sum of functors? The `Effs fs` defined here is such a sum, implemented more or less following the `freer` package. 

Actually, the items in `Effs fs` needn't be functors, nevertheless, by familiar tricks, `Eff fs` always is, and so we can stream such a bouquet of effects as we please. 

There isn't any need for a special extensible effects library, in particular for a special monad. We just need a sum-of-functors (or rather -non-functors) functor containing `scrutinize` and `inject` to put things into the sum and extract them.  Such a thing should be put alongside e.g. `Data.Functor.Sum` in the `transformers` library, or something like that. Then any construction anywhere that can make use of a functor constraint can make use of this sort of sum or union of functors and quasi-functors.  Here, we are using `Stream f m r`, and just need a few combinators, like `liftEff` and `runEffects` and `foldEffect` to help with the construction of proper effects and with folding over the stream of them.  

It is the experience of this writer - perhaps I got something wrong - that `type-aligned` is of value only where one is operating with a functor that splits, like 

    data Arith a = Plus a a | Times a a
    
then for sure you will use a right fold from the leaves in interpreting, and there is no hope of streaming. Where you are using functors that admit streaming, and comprehend the discipline of properly streaming program composition, it is generally a loss. (Similarly, I think there is no reason to use `Data.Sequence` and engage in elaborate construction of a `Seq` if you are proposing a strict left fold over the elements as they come.) In streaming program composition, especially with a transformer like `FreeT` `Stream` or `Coroutine`, one systematically avoids "re-traversing binds", and retaining references to items extracted, and accumulation in general. Everything must be destroyed as soon as it is created.

Whatever the merits of those remarks, here is a simple test program exhibiting the convenient definition of a few effects, summing them together in a single `do` block and running them together. It 

- maintains two different internal state calculations, one for Int, one for Integer
- tweets occasional nonsense
- yields both Strings and (Int,String) pairs
- makes http get and post requests

the "interpreters" then put perfectly trivial interpretations on these 'effects'
